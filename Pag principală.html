      Description- Because of a puppy, the newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland are killed in a car accident and arrive in Heaven, where they have the unpleasant surprise of finding that the bureaucracy is in full swing, so they were put on a long waiting list . Until they receive their angel wings, for 50 years they must continue to live in the old house, but as ghosts. But the house is now occupied by a couple of yuppies, Charles and Delia Deetz, whom the ghosts are unable to scare one by one. So, in desperation for the cause, a specialist is hired for this - Beetlejuice, a red-haired guy with broken teeth, who turns out not to be up to the task, especially since he falls in love with the daughter of the new owners, the teenage Lydia.
