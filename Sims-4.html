        <p>
       <em>The Sims 4 </em>is a life simulation game. Players can create a Sim character and can also explore different personalities that change the way the game is played. Sims can multitask, such as talking while performing a task.

     Creating a Sim
        </h2>
       <p>Players can directly manipulate a Sim's facial features. Players can also directly manipulate any part of the body, including the abdomen, chest, legs, and arms. This is a new feature and was not included in previous Sims games where only with fitness could fat be manipulated on a Sims body. However, fitness levels and fat levels can still be adjusted in The Sims 4 as in previous games.

The base games come with over 40 hairstyles for men and women.

Six life stages are available, including baby, child, teenager, young adult, adult and old man. The child's life stage is only accessible by birthing a Sim and is not available by creating a Sim.

The features are back! Each Sim has three traits and an aspiration that contains their own hidden trait.

Compared to previous Sims games where Casual, Formal, Sleep, Athletic, and Swimwear were restricted to having their own clothing options, all clothing options are now available in all forms of outfits and players are allowed up to 5 outfits per category.
